        <h2>Rooster and Hawk</h2>
        <div>
            <p>One day Hawk was bragging about being the fastest bird of all. Then, Rooster challenged him to a race. Hawk laughed and said “You are not fast at all. You will never beat me in a race.” But Rooster didn’t care. “I can beat you, let's race tomorrow.” - he said. 
                The next day, Rooster and Hawk got ready to race. When they started, Hawk was going much faster than Rooster. Then he got really tired, but Rooster did not. Rooster caught up with Hawk and went ahead of him. After a while. Hawk was flying again, but Rooster had already won.
